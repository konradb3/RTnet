                             RTnet Version 0.9.7
                             ===================

What is it?
-----------
RTnet is an Open Soure hard real-time network protocol stack for Xenomai and
RTAI (real-time Linux extensions). It makes use of standard Ethernet hardware
and supports several popular card chip sets, including Gigabit Ethernet.
Moreover, Ethernet-over-1394 support is available based on the RT-FireWire
protocol stack.

RTnet implements UDP/IP, ICMP and ARP in a deterministic way. It provides a
POSIX socket API to real-time user space processes and kernel modules. Access
to nondeterministic media is managed by the pluggable RTmac layer and the
actual control discipline. As default for Ethernet, a TDMA-based discipline
is provided.


What are the requirements?
--------------------------
- Linux kernel 2.6.x: tested up to 2.6.17
  Linux kernel 2.4.x: tested up to 2.4.32
- Xenomai 2.0 or better
  RTAI 3.3-cv or better
- x86, PowerPC, or ARM platform (other platforms are untested)
- RealTek 8139, Intel 8255x (EtherExpress Pro 100), Intel PRO/1000, DEC
  21x4x-based (tulip), AMD PCnet32/PCnetPCI, VIA Rhine, NatSemi DP8381x,
  RTL8169 network adapter, MPC8260 FCC, MPC8xx SCC/FEC, or MPC5200 on-chip
  controllers, SMSC LAN91C111 embedded controller
- For Ethernet-over-FireWire see rtfirewire.berlios.de
- For RT-WLAN: Ralink 2500


How to install it?
------------------
1. Install and test a suitable real-time Linux version
2. cd to a preferred directory (e.g. /usr/src)
3. tar xvjf <PATH-TO-RTNET-ARCHIVE>/rtnet-X.X.X.tar.bz2
4. cd rtnet
5. make menuconfig (run "make help" for further information)
   Set at least the real-time extension installation path and the path RTnet
   is to be installed to (called <PREFIX> from now on). You could also check
   other options if they fit your requirements. Help is available for each
   feature.
6. make
7. make install
   This will create the directories <PREFIX>/sbin with all configuration tools,
   <PREFIX>/modules containing all core modules, <PREFIX>/include with the
   required API header files, and <PREFIX>/etc with configuration files to be
   used with the rtnet startup script.
8. run "mknod /dev/rtnet c 10 240" on your target system to create the
   configuration interface device node.


How to test it?
---------------
1. Shutdown the network device which shall become part of the RT-network and
   remove its driver module (this also means that it must not be compiled
   into the kernel!)
2. Load required real-time modules (modular Xenomai: xeno_hal, xeno_nucleus,
   xeno_rtdm, RTAI: rtai_hal, rtai_ksched/rtai_lxrt, rtai_sem, rtai_rtdm)
3. Check <PREFIX>/etc/rtnet.conf and adapt at least the following parameters:
   RT_DRIVER, IPADDR, TDMA_MODE, TDMA_SLAVES.
4. Run <PREFIX>/sbin/rtnet start
5. Run rtping <remote-host> or run an example application
   (e.g. examples/xenomai/posix/rtt-{sender,responder})


Special notes
-------------
Starting the RTnet core manually (without RTmac):
  1. Load required componentes of the real-time Linux extension (see above)
  2. Load RTnet modules: rtnet (core), rtipv4 (IPv4 protocol + API), rtpacket
     (packet protocol + API), rt_loopback (rtlo loopback driver), rt_XXX
     (real-time NIC driver)
  3. Configure real-time NICs: rtifconfig rtethX up <IP>,
     rtifconfig rtlo up 127.0.0.1
  4. Add host routes to target nodes, either explicitly:
     rtroute add <target IP> <target hw-address> dev <local NIC>
     Or trigger an ARP handshake:
     rtroute solicit <target IP> dev <local NIC>
  5. Don't forget that on RTAI and on Xenomai 2.0.x the system timer has to be
     started by someone (in typical RTnet setups this is done by loading RTcfg).
